//javascript does NOT define datatypes for individual
//variables, meaning that one variable can be either a
//string or an int or a float, for example
var myVariable;
myVariable = 200; //integer
myVariable = "Hello";  //string
myVariable = 'Hello';  //same as above
myVariable = true;  //boolean
myVariable = false;  //boolean

//this can pose problems since there wont be an error
//even if the variable datatype is changed by mistake
