//OOP is breaking down your program into smaller pieces
//called objects and each (the thing itself)object or
//(idea)class has its own attributes and behaviors
//attribures or properties:
/*name
  height
  weight
  gender
  age
*/
//behaviors or methods:
/*walk
  run
  jump
  speak
  sleep
*/

//objects are created based on the class
//and can be many objects of the same class
//ENCAPSULATION is keeping the properties and methods
//contained within themselves.
